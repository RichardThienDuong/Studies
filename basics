Libraries is a collection of routines, functions, or classes, that your application code calls upon to perform a certain task. When you use a library, you are in control of the flow of the application. You choose when and where to calll the library's functionalities. Libraries don't impose a particular way of coding or application structure. 

Frameworks provides a structured base for building your application. It's more extensive and dictates the structure of your project. This structure is defined by a set of rules, interfaces, and tools that you must use or follow. The framework controls the flow of control, and it calls upon your code when needed. This is refered to as Inversion of Control. Frameworks often come with many freatures built-in, such as handling HTTP requests, managing databases, or rendering views in web developement. They help to enforce good practices and a consistent coding style , which can be beneficial for larger projects or teams .
